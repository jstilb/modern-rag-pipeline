The primary aim is to allow computers to learn automatically without human \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Types of Machine Learning\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled examples. The algorithm receives a set of inputs along with the \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"corresponding correct outputs, and the algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with correct outputs to find errors. \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Unsupervised learning is used with data that has no historical labels. The system is not told the right answer. \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Reinforcement learning is often used for robotics, gaming, and navigation.\"\"\",\n\n    # Page 2\n    \"\"\"Neural Networks and Deep Learning\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"A neural network is a series of algorithms that attempts to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. Neural networks can adapt to changing input so the network generates \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"called artificial neural networks. Deep learning uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify human-meaningful items such as \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"digits, letters, or faces.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models that are particularly effective for image recognition tasks. \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"They use convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features.\"\"\",\n\n    # Pages 3-10: NLP, transformers, RAG, etc.\n    \"\"\"Natural Language Processing\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"amounts of natural language data.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"The history of natural language processing generally started in the 1950s. Alan Turing published an article titled Computing \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Machinery and Intelligence which proposed what is now called the Turing Test as a criterion of intelligence. \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English. \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"The authors claimed that within three to five years, machine translation would be a solved problem.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Modern NLP relies heavily on transformer architectures introduced in the seminal paper Attention Is All You Need by \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Vaswani et al. (2017). The transformer uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequences in parallel.\"\"\",\n\n    # Pages 4-20: abbreviated for conciseness, still substantial content\n    \"\"\"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an AI framework for retrieving facts from an external knowledge base to ground \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"large language models (LLMs) on the most accurate, up-to-date information. RAG combines information retrieval with text generation.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"The RAG architecture consists of three components: a retriever, a reader/generator, and a knowledge base. \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"The retriever indexes a corpus of documents and fetches the most relevant passages for a given query. \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"The generator takes the retrieved passages as context and generates a grounded answer.\"\"\",\n\n    \"\"\"Chunking Strategies for RAG\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"When building a RAG system, one of the most important decisions is how to split documents into chunks for indexing. \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"The chunking strategy affects both retrieval recall and answer quality.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Fixed-size chunking splits text at fixed token intervals. It is simple and predictable but may break sentences and \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"paragraphs in inconvenient places.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Recursive chunking splits at paragraph and sentence boundaries recursively. This preserves semantic structure \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"and is the recommended default for most document types.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Semantic chunking groups sentences with high embedding similarity. This produces chunks with coherent meaning \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"but requires embedding computation during ingestion.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Sliding window chunking uses overlapping windows to avoid losing context at boundaries. The high overlap \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"produces more chunks but ensures continuity.\"\"\",\n\n    \"\"\"Vector Databases\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"A vector database is a type of database that stores data as high-dimensional vectors, which are mathematical representations \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"of features or attributes. The vectors are usually generated by machine learning models, using techniques such as word embeddings \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"for NLP applications or convolutional neural networks for image recognition tasks.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"ChromaDB is an open-source embedding database designed for AI applications. It provides efficient storage and retrieval \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"of embeddings using HNSW indexing. ChromaDB can run embedded in-process or as a standalone server.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Qdrant is a vector database written in Rust that supports native filtering during ANN search, horizontal sharding, \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"and scalar quantization for reduced memory footprint.\"\"\",\n\n    \"\"\"Hybrid Search and Reciprocal Rank Fusion\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Hybrid search combines dense vector search (semantic retrieval) with sparse keyword search (BM25) to leverage the \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"strengths of both approaches. Dense retrieval handles semantic similarity and paraphrasing; BM25 handles exact keyword \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"matching and rare terms.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) is a simple but effective method for combining multiple ranked lists. \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"The RRF score for a document d is: RRF(d) = sum(1/(k + rank_i(d))) where k=60. \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Hybrid search with RRF consistently outperforms either method alone in benchmark evaluations.\"\"\",\n\n    \"\"\"Evaluation Metrics for RAG\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Evaluating RAG systems requires measuring both retrieval quality and generation quality.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) measures retrieval quality by rewarding systems that place \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"relevant documents at the top of the ranked list. A perfect retrieval has NDCG = 1.0.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Faithfulness measures whether the generated answer is factually consistent with the retrieved context. \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"An unfaithful answer contains hallucinated facts not present in the retrieved passages.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Answer Relevance measures how well the answer addresses the user's query. \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Context Precision measures what fraction of retrieved chunks are actually useful for the answer.\"\"\",\n\n    \"\"\"Reranking for Improved Precision\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"After initial retrieval, a reranking step can substantially improve precision by applying a more expensive \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"cross-encoder model to re-score the top-k retrieved candidates.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Cross-encoder rerankers jointly encode the query and passage to produce a relevance score, unlike bi-encoders \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"that encode them independently. The cross-encoder has access to query-passage interactions, enabling more \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"accurate relevance estimation.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Cohere Rerank is a commercial reranking API that offers state-of-the-art relevance scoring without requiring \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"a local GPU. It supports multiple languages and specialized domains.\"\"\",\n\n    \"\"\"Production Deployment Considerations\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Deploying a RAG system in production requires attention to latency, reliability, and cost.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Latency: The full RAG pipeline involves embedding generation (50-200ms), vector search (5-50ms), and \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"LLM generation (2-20s for streaming). Embedding caching reduces latency for repeated queries.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Reliability: Implement circuit breakers for embedding and LLM APIs. Fall back to BM25-only retrieval \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"when the embedding API is unavailable.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Cost: Embedding costs ~$0.02 per 1M tokens. For high-traffic systems, pre-compute and cache all document \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"embeddings. LLM costs dominate at $0.01-0.03 per query for GPT-4.\"\"\",\n\n    \"\"\"FastAPI for RAG APIs\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"FastAPI is a modern Python web framework for building APIs with automatic OpenAPI documentation. \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"It uses async/await natively, making it ideal for I/O-bound RAG pipelines.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Key endpoints for a RAG API: POST /ingest for document indexing, POST /query for querying, \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"GET /health for health checks. Use SSE (Server-Sent Events) for streaming responses.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Railway is a cloud platform that provides easy deployment for FastAPI applications. \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"A Procfile or railway.toml configures the startup command: uvicorn src.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT.\"\"\",\n\n    \"\"\"Future Directions in RAG\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"The field of retrieval-augmented generation is rapidly evolving.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Multi-modal RAG extends the approach to images, audio, and video. Documents are indexed with both \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"text and image embeddings, enabling queries that combine text and visual information.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Agentic RAG uses LLM agents that iteratively refine retrieval queries based on partial results, \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"enabling multi-hop reasoning over large document collections.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Graph RAG uses knowledge graphs to enable structured traversal over document relationships, \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"going beyond flat similarity search.\"\"\",\n\n    \"\"\"Conclusion\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"This document has covered the key concepts in machine learning and retrieval-augmented generation systems. \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"The modern-rag-pipeline implements production-ready patterns including hybrid search, multiple chunking \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"strategies, evaluation metrics, and a FastAPI REST API.\\n\\n\"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Key takeaways: Use recursive chunking as your default. Implement hybrid retrieval with RRF for best NDCG. \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"Add a cross-encoder reranking step to improve precision@3.
